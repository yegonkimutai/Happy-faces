        Happy Faces Empowerment Network started as a social welfare group back in 2017 by
        young high schoolers who would visit children's homes, rescue centers, and vulnerability centers
        during holidays. After the completion of high school, the group members decided to officially register the
        organization with the government of Kenya on the 30th of March 2022. The initial exclusive
        purpose during the organization's registration was to rescue vulnerable, orphaned, disabled, and

        marginalized kids, situate them in our partner centers, and subsequently provide for their basic
        needs like food and clothing while they are there. However, a Daily Nation report of 30th March
        2023 (https://nation.africa/kenya/news/orphanage-children-the-bane-of-turning-18--4217742)
        highlighted the plight of these children once they get to the age of 18, where their contract with
        the centers end, and most of them do not get to enjoy a smooth transition into normal lives.
        Especially for the unsuccessful in their education, the males and females expressed finding
        themselves to have engaged in crime, drug abuse, drug peddling, and prostitution among other
        illegal acts. For a number, due to loss of hope, they sadly take their own lives. As a result, the
        project will allow the youth to become self-dependent once they get to the age of forced transition
        out of the children's homes and rescue centers that have been their homes for almost their whole
        childhood lives. The project provides decent work opportunities for the vulnerable, orphaned,
        disabled, and marginalized youth, assists in eradication of poverty across Kenyan society, and
        minimizes the level of socio-economic inequalities faced by these vulnerable, orphaned, disabled,
        and marginalized youth.
